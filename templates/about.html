    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>TODO Cool Picture</p>
    <p>I graduated from Florida State Unviterity in Fall of 2012. Since then I have worked for a
        Mobile Device Management company called Openpeak (2013-2016) out of Boca Raton, FL and as of spring 2016
        I am employeed by Ultimate Software working on their PaaS team.</p>

    <p>My dream is to be a dual CEO/CTO of a small startup that reallt changes the rules for humanity.
        I love making new projects from the ground up using opensource technologies,
        proven software engineering patterns, a simple design, and common sense (aka not reinventing the wheel).</p>

    <p> For fun I like to tinker and hack with computer hardware and computer sciency projects.
        You know small projects that do barely anything, but make you smile every time you use them.

            weather station</a> and <a href="/" title="homebrew router">homebrew router</a>.
        I also enjoy playing <a href="http://www.dotabuff.com/players/4778078" title="DOTA"> DOTA</a>
        in my spare time with old and new friends. Although, I'll admit that I am not great lol (MID FOR FEED!, jkjk)
        Besides technology stuff I enjoy snowboarding in Colorado, and boating in Florida and the Florida keys.</p>
