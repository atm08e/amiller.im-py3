    <h1>Welcome to Amiller.im</h1>
    <h3>Personal website of Drew, w00t</h3>
    <p>Hi, this websites purpose is for sharing my technological opinions, trip vacation pictures, and keeping my full stack engineering
        skills up to date. I particularly like building applications in Python3, PHP7, and C++14.
        Javascript is the worst language ever and should be wiped from existence.
        Devops is just a trait of a solid engineer.</p>

    <p><b>4/29/16</b> - Redid the website in a full server side rendered python 3 stack. Dedicated post to come soon with my motivations for this,
        hopefully soon..
        Hoping that this website will be funner to work on now that I convinced myself to just stay away from javascript world.</p>

    <p><b>3/02/16</b> - Website Online! This website is a work in progress, links will be broken, wild cats will apear,
        and will be updated rapidly in the coming days/weeks </p>
