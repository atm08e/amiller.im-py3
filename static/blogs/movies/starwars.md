I just saw the new movie a 2nd time. Here are my random ramblings/ranting of why I hate the new Franchise. I guess I am writing this to vent and hoping some people share my view point. If you enjoyed the movie I am happy for you and this post probably isn’t for you (don’t want to rain on your parade).

/Start Rant

I didn’t like TFA when it came out and never understood all the praise it received. With TLJ I had my expectations set really low and I agree with all the criticisms its getting. I’m glad that people are starting to wake up and realize that Disney picking up the Franchise is the worst thing that could have happened to it.

1) **Luke Skywalker** - My biggest compliant of the entire new series. I could have lived with the other stuff.
All I wanted from these new movies was to see Luke Skywalker as a Jedi Master post ROTJ and in action one last time, a childhood hero of mine. First of all, why did it take 1 full movie for Luke Skywalker to even be in the movie wtf (TFA)? For me I feel like he should of naturally of been the star of TFA and with an organic transition to our new heroes by the middle of the 2nd movie. I feel like this is a pretty simple and basic ask for episode 7.
Why when he finally did show up he was a complete pussy and not the Luke Skywalker hero we all grew up with and loved? They kinda of go into him being emo about messing up with Kylo Ren blah blah. But why the hell wasn’t Luke’s Jedi Academy part of the first movie. Why didn’t we get to see this happen and develop? The whole first movie could have centered around that, and how Snoke seduced Kylo Ren to the dark side. They could have also used time in that movie to build up Snoke’s and the First Orders background too. Like where is the backstory on all these characters? The end of the first movie should have been Kylo running off with Snoke after killing Luke/Leia/Han leaving Rey, Fin (why isn’t Fin a jedi again?), and other young Jedi’s to complete their own training (maybe from Yoda IDK), what a cliff hanger that would have been…
I lost it when I saw Luke throw the Light Saber over the cliff as it is essentially symbolic of what Disney and Jar Jar Abrams just did with the entire franchise. Embarrassing. 
The nail in the coffin was when Luke died from running out of force power (mana). Like it would have been way better for him to pull his x-wing out of the water, speed over to whatever planet they were on, and go out like the great Jedi he is. Not only would it have redeemed his pussy ass character and solidified his legacy, but also developed Kylo Ren to show how powerful he truly has come. It felt like such a betrayal from Disney and Jar Jar Abrams on Luke Skywalker’s legacy. Fuck Disney.

2) **Original writing/plots**
Tired of all the remaking, rebooting, mirroring, instead of taking the time to come up with an original story that progresses the story in a meaningful way. It really should not be that difficult considering the plethora of really well written Star Wars literature that is out there to pull from. Instead we got a shitty plot and characters written by a whole bunch hacks at Disney that’s last concern is for the Star Wars and first concern is selling stuffed owl (the things on the island) creatures to kids. Write a great story and all the merchandise would have followed natural after.

3) **No swagger or emotion left in Star Wars**
Re watch the first 5 minutes of a New Hope and observe how you feel after the opening scene, now compare it to the parody we got in the first 5 minutes of TLJ.
Or the last 20 minutes of ROTJ of how happy you get when they destroy the emperor, death star, and save Darth Vader. It brings tears to my eyes.
What’s the equivalent of Jabba’s and his Palace and Bar. 
Han Solo witty jokes and shooting first compared to the awkward out of place jokes inserted randomly throughout the new movies.
Any time Darth Vader or the Emperor are on screen, that feeling of terror and power compared with emo Kylo Ren and Snoke. Snoke was “okay” up until the way he went out.

4) **Political Correctness > Star Wars**
It should be the other way around. Star Wars should come first in a Star Wars movie. I cant believe I have to say this! I am all for having a diverse cast but these movies seem to be going out of their way to promote political correctness over just being Star Wars.
There are no masculine white males on the good side. (Luke isn’t masculine anymore), also apparently all white people are bad.
Woman are in charge of everything on the good side and just bark orders to their sub servant cave men. 
Need to make sure the diversity of the entire cast is slanted to minorities even though it doesn’t make any sense in a world full of droids and aliens. 
They should just rename the movie to Mary Sue and the Diversity Crew, because it isn’t Star Wars that’s for sure.

**Conclusion** 
I am tired of people making excuses for the movies instead of just seeing them for the dumpster fires that they really are. I feel bad for everyone because I can see that they really care. Like we should be having deeper questions about the movie but instead we are asking basic questions about shallow characters and nonexistent plot points. Maybe everyone is just in shock and trying to get to terms of what they just saw. Think for a moment, out of all the awesome possibilities that could have been for this once in a lifetime opportunity to make a new Star Wars series realize the load of shit they delivered to us. Disgusting.
George Lucas was right when he said “Don’t blame me when Star Wars sucks” I would prefer 7,8,9 being in the style of 1,2,3 over this crock of Disney shit. As far as I am concerned Disney and JarJar Abrams ruined Star Wars forever and they should never be forgiven. Instead paid critics give the movie A+ rating, and of course the kids love it, setting us up for more shitty movies/series repeating the cycle endlessly. Uhg at least Hollywood didn’t fuck up the new Blade Runner thank god. If you made it this far thank you for your time and patience /endrant
